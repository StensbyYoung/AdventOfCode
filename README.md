# Advent of Code

- A repository containing all my code for Advent of Code.

- If you want to run the code yourself, make sure to build the executable into the a folder on the same level as the data, include, and src folders. Then run the executable from that location. The reason being that currently the path to data/input.txt uses the current_path method from the filesystem library, which seems to return the path that the user ran the executable from.
